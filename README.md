# Netflix-Purchase-Behavior-Sales-Performance-Dashboard-2025-
This Power BI dashboard explores customer purchasing trends, top-performing products, regional revenue distribution, and salesperson effectiveness based on Netflix’s 2025 sales dataset.
Designed as a unified business intelligence tool, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to evaluate who buys the most, what sells best, and which markets are revenue hubs. It's especially useful for sales leaders, demand planners, and product strategists looking to grow revenue intelligently.
Pre-Analysis: What I Set Out to Discover
Before visualization, I studied the raw transactional dataset with these key business questions in mind:
Which regions and cities generated the most revenue?
Who are our top salespeople and highest-spending customers?
Which products drive the highest revenue — and in what quantity?
Are there visible revenue gaps across territories or customer types?
To add structure to the analysis, I identified attributes like region, product name, ship city, salesperson, quantity, and customer ID — each acting as a lens for segmentation and insight.
